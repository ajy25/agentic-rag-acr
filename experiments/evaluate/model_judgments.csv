0.5,"The candidate correctly identifies surgical resection/biopsy (VATS or open) as options that do not inherently require ionizing radiation, which aligns with the reference answer’s ‘surgical lung biopsy/resection.’ However, it omits the other acceptable non–ionizing strategies from the reference (follow-up imaging only and conservative management) and instead adds bronchoscopic approaches, which the reference explicitly notes typically rely on ionizing imaging (fluoroscopy/CT). Thus, the answer is partially correct but incomplete and partly inconsistent with the reference.",0.5,"Correctly identifies surgical lung biopsy/resection and conservative management as not inherently requiring ionizing radiation, but incorrectly includes bronchoscopic biopsy as an option. In this context, bronchoscopic biopsy is considered to typically rely on imaging guidance/fluoroscopy involving ionizing radiation. The answer also incorrectly excludes follow-up imaging only, which is listed in the reference as an acceptable non–ionizing-radiation intervention strategy for this question.",0.5,"Correctly identifies surgical lung biopsy/resection and conservative management as non–ionizing interventions, but incorrectly includes bronchoscopic biopsy. In the context of the question and reference, bronchoscopic biopsy is considered to typically rely on ionizing radiation–based imaging (e.g., fluoroscopy), so it should not have been listed. Also incorrectly excludes follow-up imaging only, which the reference counts as an option that could be considered in this scenario."
